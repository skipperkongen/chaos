A deterministic and bounded system is chaotic if tiny perturbations to the system get exponentially amplified ([Article in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0715-9)]). The idea that small causes may have large effects in weather was recognized early on by French mathematician and engineer [Henri Poincar√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9).

You can get more intuition on Chaos Theory by watching this excellent [introdution video](https://youtu.be/fDek6cYijxI) by Veratasium. In the video he elaborates on the chaotic case discovered by meteorologist Edward Lorenz, coined the [butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect), where a small difference in rounding caused a deterministic model of the atmospere to evolve radically different from almost identical initial conditions.

This is my journey to understand this concept better. I want to learn the following.

- How to determine if a fully simulated system (i.e. a set of equations) is [formally chaotic](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/gottwald/preprints/chaos1.pdf).

I do not aim to learn:

- How to determine if [observational data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0715-9) comes from a chaotic real-world system.
